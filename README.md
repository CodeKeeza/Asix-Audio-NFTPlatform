# Axis Audio NFT Platform

## Early Development Stage

Protocol works on the basis that there will be a central contract that houses all of our primary data
that all other contracts will treat as the source of truth for verification and validation.

DailyPot will be our issuance system for tokens either implemented in an autonomous way or a more
hands-on approach, yet to be decided. The pot will receieves external commands that will force it
to update user earnings for that period and distribute them physically or on-paper until they are
claimed by the user, yet to be decided on method of harvest for users.

MainProtocol will house the neccessary logic to allow the dApp to have features discussed amongst
the development team.
